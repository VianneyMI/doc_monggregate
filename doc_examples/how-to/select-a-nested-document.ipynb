I really liked his apartment. \\n\\nIt is very well located, the restaurants and bars around are great and in an easy 30 minute walk you are downtown or in old Montreal. Very pleasant area to be outside and felt very safe. \\n\\nAlfredo always answered my messages within 5 minutes and was incredibly helpful and generous. \\n\\nI highly recommend this place. Thank you Alfredo!'}"
